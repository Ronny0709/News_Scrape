# How did I started this project?
In my role as a research team member for "Wooridachi," an application designed to close cultural gaps between Korean and Japanese college students over shared articles and news, I joined a project to enhance information-gathering efficiency.

Collaborating closely with the content team, my task involved researching trending news articles for the post-launch of the app.
Identifying the difficulty of scraping information from articles manually, searching for trending topics, I came up with an idea of creating a dashboard to catch the trending keywords among thousands of articles.

# What is the goal of this project?
The primary objective of this project was to analyze the prevalence of specific keywords in news articles from various media outlets across Korea and Japan. Initially, the plan was to scrape articles and examine keyword frequencies to catch topical trends in each country. However, I encountered challenges due to the complex linguistic structures of Korean and Japanese languages, which complicated the scraping process.

To circumvent these issues, I selected ["JapanTimes,"](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/) an English-language news website covering categories such as Asia-Pacific, Japan, and World. I focused on extracting titles, brief summaries, authors, and publication dates from the articles. This data would enable a comprehensive analysis of the most frequently used keywords within each category and the thematic focus of each author's work.

The ultimate aim of this initiative is to develop a comprehensive dashboard that aggregates and displays this information, giving easier access to trends and insights derived from the collected data.

I converted the final dataset into a .csv format, which I used in Tableau to construct an interactive dashboard. 
The interactive dashboard shows insight into article trends, author contribution, and the popularity of keywords.

# Further Improvement
Moving forward, I want to refine this project by integrating user log data to track reader preferences and interests, enabling targeted content curation. 
Additionally, accessing raw data directly from corporations will allow more time for in-depth data analysis and visualization that will further my development as a data analyst.
